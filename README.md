# network-connection

I created this repository to create a program that monitors my internet connectivity and plots graphs of response time and connectivity status.

By default it checks connectivity every 5 seconds by issuing a request to google.com. 

I created this because I notice something wierd about my internet, I was loosing it around 15 mins intervals and then if I reload the page it is working. 
I plotted the graph and was able to confirm this issue. I was  in talks with my internet provider about loosing connectivity often. But whenever he checked. I was getting internet. After plotting this graph I was able to show clear evidence. He came in an hour and found the issue was with my modem. He replaced it and the isssue is now sorted.
